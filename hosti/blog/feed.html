										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://neilpatel.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Neil Patel</a> is a New York Times Bestselling author, entrepreneur, and top web influencer. Forbes notices him as one of the top 10 marketers, President Obama recognizes him as a top 100 entrepreneur under the age of 30, and Entrepreneur Magazine lists him as a creator of one of the 100 most brilliant companies. By helping businesses with innovative strategies, Neil Patel has gained immense popularity with his entrepreneurial and digital marketing skills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are delighted to be announced as Neil Patel’s top pick for best overall web hosting services, VPS hosting plans, and WordPress hosting. This article shares the significant reasons behind it.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-1-web-hosting-services"><strong>#1 Web Hosting Services</strong></h3>



<p>Having a reliable web host is a must in today’s web world. Therefore, to find the best web hosting provider, Neil Patel focuses on the quality of services and checks uptime reliability, loading speed, and customer service excellence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He shares recommendations for the <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/best-web-hosting-services/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">best web hosting services</a> in 2021 and lists Hostinger as the first choice for those customers searching specifically for reliable <a href="../home.html" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">shared hosting services</a>. Affordable prices, instant loading speed, and daily website backups are noticed as the major contributing factors. Also, the expert 24/7/365 Hostinger customer support is mentioned as a massive perk for enterprises with a small or non-existent IT staff.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>#1 WordPress Hosting</strong></h3>



<p>Neil Patel has been using WordPress blogs as a principal part of his business for many years. Thus substantial hands-on experience allows evaluating multiple web hosting options. Shared vs. Managed WordPress hosting opportunities, traffic volume, speed, uptime, and technical support are considered to compare offerings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hostinger is mentioned as the best <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/best-wordpress-web-hosting/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">WordPress website host</a>. Rock-bottom pricing, an essential package of features and resources necessary to create, design, and manage a WordPress site, and the ease of use even for the first-time creator are the key characteristics leading to success here. The supporting factors include the free email account, domain name, CDN, and a free SSL certificate and ensure a smooth, fast and secure online journey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hostinger has optimized the <a href="../wordpress-hosting.html" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">WordPress experience</a> for customers &#8211; the LiteSpeed cache accelerates sites performance and works nicely with most popular plugins. Additionally, a helpful set of tools to get the site looking professional is offered to take advantage of and improve it at no cost.</p>



<h3><strong>#1 VPS Hosting Plans</strong></h3>



<p>VPS allows customers to get a private slice of server resources; thus, getting one of the VPS hosting plans could drastically improve site performance. Neil Patel emphasizes the capacity of resources not to worry, distinction of total control vs. shared responsibility, timely and tech-savvy support as the primary reasons for his choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to him, the <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/best-vps-hosting/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">best VPS hosting services</a> for most people are offered by Hostinger. Attractive prices and an approachable interface make this service exceptionally splendid for first-time users. Even if it is a <a href="../vps-hosting.html" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">semi-managed plan</a> offering a great mix of support and freedom to scale, Hostinger customer support agents are available, and additional helpful content is always linked. Also, a solid range of OS choices, including CentOS, Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, or Suse, are included and need only one click to install.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With the development of the Internet, continuous learning and gaining new skills is inevitable in the technology era. However, in some remote and suburban areas, it still seems like a challenging process. For this reason, in early May 2021, Hostinger and Niagahoster started a significant milestone to provide better and more proper education facilities in Indonesia by rebuilding Wali Ate Middle School.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="CSR Project by Niagahoster X Hostinger: Wali Ate Middle School Reconstruction" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ptHSQjiSwmw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h2 id="h-corporate-social-responsibility-and-impact-on-the-local-community"><strong>Corporate Social Responsibility and Impact on the Local Community&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The school facility is located in Wali Ate, Southwest Sumba, East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. Sumba is one of over 550 islands of Nusa Tenggara Timur and is considered one of Indonesia’s most impoverished and underdeveloped areas. Most households have no electricity, running water, or adequate sanitation. Whereas children lack the opportunity to access proper education.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, choosing Indonesia was not accidental. Hostinger and our subsidiary Niagahoster are fortunate to build a school in a country where we have offices ourselves. We recognize it as an opportunity to be close to the local community and see the direct impact on the learning environment.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Collaboration with Happy Hearts Indonesia</strong></h2>



<p>With the help of implementing partner <a href="https://happyheartsindonesia.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Happy Hearts Indonesia</a>, children in Sumba, Indonesia, will receive education in a safe, earthquake-resilient school building. To achieve this goal, renovations were carried out, from rebuilding classrooms, sanitation, toilets to providing books and stationery for teaching and learning purposes. After reconstruction Happy Hearts Indonesia will conduct WASH (Water, Sanitation &amp; Hygiene) as well as disaster readiness training to educate students, teachers and communities. Additionally, teacher and school management programs together with literacy courses for students will be run for five years to guide each school toward self-sustainability.</p>

<p>The spirit of #BuildSuccessOnline and unlocking the power of the Internet is the incentive for Hostinger and Niagahoster to develop products and share its technology and benefits with millions of people worldwide by giving them tools and facilities to learn, create, and grow. We hope this great initiative is only the beginning for future endeavours broadening horizons!&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the past few years, Hostinger has grown into a company with over 1 thousand employees, all spread across 35 countries.&nbsp;Even before the pandemic, global remote working has already been ingrained in our company’s culture. As such, we strive to nurture our multicultural environment and make everyone feel heard – regardless of geography or cultural background.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Throughout the years, we have learned many lessons and achieved great success with our multicultural teams. We’re here to share our experiences and how we’ve overcome the challenges that come our way.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-advantages-of-a-multicultural-team"><strong>What Are the Advantages of a Multicultural Team?</strong></h2>



<p>For us, cultural diversity offers various benefits that enable us to both create a healthy work environment and optimize our services.&nbsp;Here’s what we’ve found:</p>



<h4 id="h-innovative-work-environment"><strong><em>Innovative Work Environment</em></strong></h4>



<p id="h-in-a-multicultural-workplace-people-come-in-with-different-ideas-and-personality-traits-brought-over-from-their-cultures-and-lifestyles-and-more-often-than-not-having-access-to-multiple-viewpoints-can-inspire-creativity-and-out-of-the-box-thinking">In a multicultural workplace, people come in with different ideas and personality traits brought over from their cultures and lifestyles. And more often than not, having access to multiple viewpoints can inspire creativity and out-of-the-box thinking.</p>



<p>In fact, a BCG survey found that diverse and inclusive teams are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesinsights/2020/01/15/diversity-confirmed-to-boost-innovation-and-financial-results/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>45%</strong> more innovative</a> than their average counterparts. The research was conducted in 1,700 companies in multiple countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Hostinger’s Squad Leader Emma Young, having a multicultural team means that “you won’t always approach tasks or issues the same way. You get to learn different cultures, ways of life, habits, things that are common or uncommon. It helps open your eyes and see things differently than you are used to.”</p>



<h4 id="h-local-market-insights"><strong><em>Local Market Insights</em></strong></h4>



<p id="h-as-a-customer-obsessed-company-we-want-to-make-sure-that-every-client-in-all-of-our-39-locales-is-happy-having-a-multicultural-team-helps-us-understand-their-needs-and-deliver-exactly-that">As a <strong>Customer-Obsessed</strong> company, we want to make sure that every client in all of our 39 locales is happy. Having a multicultural team helps us understand their needs and deliver exactly that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“From a work-related standpoint, it’s really important that I get to understand how different our audiences are. My team members offer me invaluable insight into the readers, their preferences, and interests, which helps me shape strategies tailored to each market individually.”</p>



<p>According to Hostinger’s Vita Klimaitė, working with people all over the globe makes her job as an SEO Content Manager much easier.</p>



<h4 id="h-cultural-exchange"><strong><em>Cultural Exchange</em></strong></h4>



<p id="h-for-many-hostinger-employees-having-multiple-cultures-represented-in-the-same-team-is-exciting-as-well">For many Hostinger employees, having multiple cultures represented in the same team is exciting as well. It lends us the opportunity to see the world through our peers’ eyes from the comfort of our homes – or wherever we choose to work. Before the pandemic, employees also had the opportunity to travel to other locales and experience the local culture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For SEO English-Indonesian Translator Ariata, getting to share her country in team-building activities is one of her favorite parts of the job. “It makes me feel happy and proud when I get the chance to introduce Indonesia to my coworkers – whether through sharing stories, my favorite spicy foods, or pictures of the Indonesian country.”</p>



<h4 id="h-increased-productivity-and-profitability"><strong><em>Increased Productivity and Profitability</em></strong></h4>



<p id="h-a-study-by-the-academy-of-management-journal-revealed-a-correlation-between-racial-diversity-in-management-and-productivity">A study by the Academy of Management Journal revealed a correlation between <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/racially-diverse-management-boosts-tech-firms-productivity-study-finds/579729/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">racial diversity in management</a> and productivity.&nbsp;According to the research, a <strong>1%</strong> growth in diversity in a tech firm led to increased productivity, with each employee bringing an added <strong>$729</strong>. The study also emphasized that companies with high diversity in upper and lower management have the best performance.</p>



<p>A McKinsey report on <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/diversity%20and%20inclusion/diversity%20wins%20how%20inclusion%20matters/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters-vf.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">diversity and inclusion</a> also supports this conclusion. The researchers discovered that companies with high ethnic and cultural diversity were more likely to perform <strong>36%</strong> higher financially than their peers. When nourished properly, multicultural diversity can have a positive impact on the vital aspects of a business. Of course, working in such an environment may also bring its fair share of disadvantages.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-challenges-do-multicultural-teams-face"><strong>What Challenges Do Multicultural Teams Face?</strong></h2>



<p>We’ve looked into our teams for their insights to answer this question. Here are several challenges to navigating a culturally diverse environment:</p>



<h4 id="h-communication-differences"><strong><em>Communication Differences</em></strong></h4>



<p>Since Hostinger is a global and multicultural company, we mainly use English to communicate with one another. Despite speaking the same language, however, communication barriers can still arise.&nbsp; As we’ve all been raised in different cultural environments, it’s only natural that the way we express ideas and opinions also varies.</p>



<p>As a squad leader, Emma finds this aspect difficult to navigate, especially when practicing one of our Hostinger principles – <strong>Courage and Candidness</strong>. “With the cultural differences that our team has, each culture has very different approaches when it comes to talking to your manager, colleagues, team leads, etc. So figuring out what can be said and in what way takes a bit of time.”</p>



<p>Without the proper knowledge and preparation, messages can get lost in translation and result in unintended consequences. Hence, adjusting your communication style is always important, whether you’re the one receiving or delivering the feedback.</p>



<h4 id="h-cultural-differences"><strong><em>Cultural Differences</em></strong></h4>



<p>In addition, there may also be obstacles in understanding that what works in one culture may not succeed in another. Such was the experience that Ariata faced when she began working at Hostinger. As a translator, she has to be able to localize various marketing copies for the Indonesian market. However, there were several cases where she thought the materials themselves wouldn’t work with the audience.</p>



<p>“In Indonesia, we don’t really have what’s called a ‘summer sale’ because the weather is warm all year round. So I thought launching a campaign like that wouldn’t work here. It took some time to get them to understand that some campaign ideas would have to be readjusted.”</p>



<p>This issue can occur in other facets of a business. For instance, when recruiting a person from another country, the local talent pool’s skill set and work expectations may differ from where you live. These aspects are crucial to consider before posting a job online.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="h-time-zone-conflicts"><strong><em>Time Zone Conflicts</em></strong></h4>



<p>For remote multicultural teams, finding the right time to have a meeting can be a hurdle – especially with people living on a different continent altogether.&nbsp;“Any kind of team meeting we schedule is late in the evening for some and very early in the morning for others. It makes quality team buildings and extensive meetings a hard task,” says Vita.</p>



<p>Time zone conflicts can also make it difficult to work on deadline-sensitive tasks. If an employee needs immediate assistance or a second opinion, they may need to wait several hours to get a response from their coworkers.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-how-hostinger-unifies-a-multicultural-team"><strong>How Hostinger Unifies a Multicultural Team</strong></h2>



<p>At Hostinger, we believe the perks of a multicultural work environment outweigh its challenges. Therefore, we always look for the best ways to nurture culturally diverse teams and sharpen these practices as we grow.</p>



<p>While there are many ways to achieve this, we believe the best practice is to start with the<strong> company principles</strong>. These are values that govern how everyone at the company should complete their tasks and make decisions on an individual, team, and organizational level – regardless of where they’re from and what they look like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hostinger principles are a constant metric to evaluate people and how they perform. Everyone has personal preferences, personality traits, and cultural aspects that shape who we are. Having the principles helps to <strong>unify our differences</strong> and align ourselves with Hostinger’s goals and vision,” says Laura Želvytė, our Content Production Team Lead.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/08/yogja-volcano-768x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-1914" width="300" height="400" srcset="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/08/yogja-volcano-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/08/yogja-volcano-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/08/yogja-volcano.jpeg 888w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure></div>



<p>While each principle has its own role, <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/customer-loyalty-hostinger" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">Customer Obsession</a> plays a major part in bridging gaps whenever there are differing perspectives and approaches. For Laura, it’s a goal that brings all of us together.</p>



<p>“Customer Obsession is the understanding that we all work in order to help our customers and improve their online journeys. We apply who we are, how we think, what we do in order to produce the best possible output for our customers. All of the other principles tie in and further support Customer Obsession.”</p>



<p>There are several ways we strengthen Hostinger values in our multicultural teams. One is by holding a team-level workshop every quarter and having an open discussion on what the principles mean to each person.&nbsp;“These workshops help us all be on the same page. Everyone is an individual with different life and work experience, so doing them helps us understand the why and how behind the principles,” says Laura. She also recommends incorporating the company principles into one-on-ones with direct reports and employee coaching programs. That way, they can focus on the areas they struggle with the most and find ways for improvement.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-best-practices-for-working-with-culturally-diverse-teams"><strong>Best Practices for Working With Culturally Diverse Teams</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/08/yogja-jeep-768x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-1913" width="356" height="475" srcset="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/08/yogja-jeep-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/08/yogja-jeep-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/08/yogja-jeep.jpeg 888w" sizes="(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px" /></figure></div>



<p>Besides using company principles as a unifying guideline, here are some tried-and-true tips to work with and manage multicultural teams:</p>



<h4 id="h-prioritize-psychological-safety"><strong><em>Prioritize Psychological Safety</em></strong></h4>



<p><a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/foster-psychological-safety/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Psychological safety</a> is one of the metrics we use to measure a successful team. Introduced by behavioral scientist Amy Edmondson, it refers to how safe employees feel to take risks, ask for help, or point out problems at a workplace.&nbsp; In a multicultural team, psychological safety is vital to supporting diversity and inclusion. When each member can express themselves confidently without experiencing punishment, they will feel more welcomed and valued by the company.</p>



<p>Psychological safety allows tapping into the key benefit of a diverse work environment – innovation. If everyone feels safe to voice their opinions, they will be more open to experimentation and making mistakes, which can lead to creative outcomes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At Hostinger, one of the ways we strive for psychological safety is through <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/how-to-create-a-pulse-survey-for-any-audience/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pulse surveys</a>. We send them regularly to employees’ to check on their openness to taking risks, dependability on fellow colleagues, understanding of team structure, and job satisfaction.&nbsp;Doing so enables us to understand which areas we need to improve. Each team leader will get access to the results, so they can have an open conversation on how to support their members’ needs better.</p>



<h4 id="h-have-an-open-mind"><strong><em>Have an Open Mind</em></strong></h4>



<p>In the book <em>7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em>, Stephen Covey writes, “Seek first to understand then to be understood.” Before we can get others to follow our way of thinking, accept that they’ll have different approaches to certain situations.</p>



<p>“Not everything is going to be the black-and-white way that you see things. You have to be open to change, open to understanding, and welcoming to anything that isn’t the ‘norm’ to you,” says Emma.&nbsp;As such, <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/compassion-at-work-leadership/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">leading with compassion</a> is important.&nbsp;This can show up as actively listening without preconceived judgments or delivering feedback without blaming the other person. Besides smoothening communication, doing so can build ownership and get rid of any accumulated anxiety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On a related note, <a href="https://ideas.ted.com/do-you-take-things-personally-and-who-doesnt-heres-how-to-stop/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avoid taking things personally</a> when receiving criticism. During a feedback session, focus on overcoming the problem and finding a win-win solution.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="h-get-to-know-your-team-members-and-colleagues"><strong><em>Get to Know Your Team Members and Colleagues</em></strong></h4>



<p>Our<strong> Learn and Be Curious</strong> principle doesn’t just apply to our work – it can also mean getting to know more about coworkers’ backgrounds and outlooks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Get to know their culture, their families, what they do for fun, and it will help understand and manage easier,” says Emma. “Learn to trust your team and they will trust you. You can’t come into a meeting, guns blazing, expecting your team to just bow down. It takes time and it can’t be forced or faked.”</p>



<p>For managers and team leaders, learning more about direct reports can offer more insight into how to lead them better. Vita recommends asking questions about their past professional experiences, from why they changed jobs, what an ideal team looks like for them, to where they see themselves professionally.</p>



<p>“We have biases and assumptions about how professional relationships work based on the work culture we know. You’d be surprised to see how different the expectations for a good team lead or manager are based on the background of your team members,” says Vita.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On top of that, she likes to suggest scheduling one-on-one sessions among team members, where they can bond and exchange knowledge.&nbsp;“It will be easier for everyone to fit that into their schedules as they won’t need to adjust too many time zones and the team will stay in close touch even without constant group calls.”</p>



<h4 id="h-adjust-your-leadership-styles-to-each-team-member"><strong><em>Adjust Your Leadership Styles to Each Team Member</em></strong></h4>



<p>One of the most essential tasks for a manager is to help team members feel comfortable in their job and achieve the goals they want to accomplish in the company.&nbsp;For Laura, one of the best ways to do so is to “adapt your managerial methods to each individual. Different people will need different coaching techniques, different communication approaches, and different motivations to keep them going.”</p>



<p>In other words, it’s crucial to incorporate <strong>Customer Obsession </strong>into your leadership philosophy, with the team members as customers. Start by figuring out what your direct reports need the most and let that information guide the next steps.</p>



<h4 id="h-host-a-cultural-exchange-event"><strong><em>Host a Cultural Exchange Event</em></strong></h4>



<p>Having people do a show-and-tell of their cultures is another great way to promote inclusiveness in a multicultural environment. It allows employees to display their culture with pride and get to know one another better.</p>



<p>Last February through April, Hostinger’s Localization team launched an initiative where each locale’s representatives would present insights about their country and market.&nbsp;For Ariata, this lends her the opportunity to represent Indonesia proudly and educate her colleagues about marketing to the locals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I really wanted to do a great presentation and make sure all the correct information would be there. Not just about Indonesia itself but also the people’s buying behaviors and what influenced our cultural perceptions. That way, when the Marketing teams want to launch another campaign, they already know what to prepare for.”&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="h-keep-experimenting"><strong><em>Keep Experimenting</em></strong></h4>



<p>We believe that the practices above are the best starting points for working in a multicultural workplace. With that in mind, we also acknowledge that every team will come its own unique characteristics and challenges. There is no one-size-fits-all approach that can suit every dynamic, so finding the right system to facilitate your team’s needs may take some time and experimentation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For some final thoughts, take a look at what Emma has to say about working with multicultural teams: &#8220;Take it day by day. I have seen my squad and other members of the Content Team open up and be vulnerable. They have started to give face-to-face feedback once we all started to understand each other and learn about each other.”</p>



<p>“From virtual coffee chats to company values workshops, just having lunch together, you name it, we’ve probably tried it. But it’s a slow and steady process – and I’m in no rush.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>You can think of Minecraft as a virtual LEGO. But here your white lego block can easily become green, red, blue or any other color in just a second. You can rotate it, flip it according to your needs. And there are no limits to restrict your imagination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As this game was released in 2011, its popularity still skyrockets. Hostinger goes hand in hand with the latest gaming trends. Yet, to offer a <a href="../minecraft-server-hosting.html" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">fully customizable Minecraft server</a> that matches players’ needs, we are thrilled to have true Minecraft enthusiasts as engaged employees. Hostinger’s Developer <strong>Tautvydas Dulskis</strong>, WorkSpace IT Administrator <strong>Eimantas Miežalis</strong>, Junior Customer Success Specialist <strong>Paulius Naudžiūnas</strong>, and UX/UI Designer<strong> Ana Jurša</strong> share their insights on Minecraft and gaming experience.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-logic-behind-minecraft-and-the-way-we-play"><strong>Logic Behind Minecraft and The Way We Play</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Tautvydas-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1887" width="222" height="222" srcset="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Tautvydas-copy.jpg 512w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Tautvydas-copy-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Tautvydas-copy-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 222px) 100vw, 222px" /><figcaption>Tautvydas Dulskis, Developer</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Tautvydas</strong> describes Minecraft as a game that helps create things with the freedom to infinity &#8211; use blocks and make your own computer, build art galleries, program new mods by yourself, or invite friends to explore the Minecraft world together. He has been familiar with Minecraft since 2004-2005 &#8211; from the very first Alpha version when there was only block development. Currently, <strong>Tautvydas</strong> and his wife enjoy building their own Minecraft cities and are sure that their children will join them once they start using computers.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Eimantas-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1888" width="233" height="233" srcset="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Eimantas-copy.jpg 512w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Eimantas-copy-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Eimantas-copy-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px" /><figcaption>Eimantas Miežalis, WorkSpace IT Administrator</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>On the other hand, <strong>Eimantas</strong> sees Minecraft as a canvas in which you can draw with blocks with your imagination as the only limit. Some players here are builders; others &#8211; technical enthusiasts. Some people have pursued their careers with the help of Minecraft; others have composed parodies from Minecraft, such as the one on Lady Gaga’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBruyCv40_0&amp;t=86s" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">song</a>. However, everyone is invited to use Minecraft for different things, and there are unlimited possibilities to do it. <strong>Eimantas</strong> started playing Minecraft when he was eight years old. The other Lithuanian player who Eimantas met online taught him to play. As a teenager, he started running various servers that required more technical expertise and got acquainted with the JAVA programming language by creating various plugins, mods, additions, etc. Now Minecraft has <em>vanilla</em> zinc for Eimantas &#8211; especially during quarantine, this game still attracts him to play.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-conquering-its-way-to-game-olympics"><strong>Conquering Its Way to Game Olympics</strong></h3>



<p>Minecraft has no age limits; even game developers themselves try to adapt the game to as early-aged players as possible, even for the first graders at school. It teaches students to program, write codes, and think logically by applying Minecraft frameworks with special modifications. Kids start it because there is a vast choice to try something different, socialize. In adolescence, by becoming familiar with the programming itself, teenagers can create mods that become popular among others and share what they discover and build a community. Over the age of 20, players are more prone to the creative process in this game &#8211; programming, developing more sophisticated modpacks, or creating art installations.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Ana-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1889" width="234" height="234" srcset="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Ana-copy.jpg 512w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Ana-copy-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Ana-copy-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 234px) 100vw, 234px" /><figcaption>Ana Jurša, UX/UI Designer</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Hostinger’s UX/UI Designer <strong>Ana </strong>believes that Minecraft stands out from most computer games &#8211; a different graphical interface, unlimited possibilities give it a tremendous advantage. Inexhaustibility leads it to success as well as no single goal and end. Everything depends on the player himself in Minecraft. The goal of the survival mode is to survive, complete missions, take care of materials, raise the level of tools, whereas in creative mode, with unlimited resources, a player can think of and set various goals for himself. Minecraft enthusiasts can use the principle of art to create landscapes, architecture, or even paintings. The game may not appeal to those who want to have a particular goal, but when they break it through, they understand the essence of Minecraft and rediscover it.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Paulius-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1890" width="233" height="233" srcset="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Paulius-copy.jpg 512w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Paulius-copy-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Paulius-copy-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px" /><figcaption>Paulius Naudžiūnas, Junior Customer Success Specialist</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Our Junior Customer Success Specialist <strong>Paulius, </strong>who has been playing Minecraft for almost 10 years, believes that this game is valued due to its expandability and a lot of freedom in what and how you want to play. A player can create his own rules. Additionally, Minecraft is super accessible on all devices and has cross-play. Are you tired of how the game looks? Add extra packs, resource packs, sound packs, shaders, mods, and make it into an entirely new game that you can sink in a bunch of hours again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Minecraft game concept still remains the leading one even if more and more similar games are being released.<strong> Tautvydas </strong>notices Fortnite or Rodblox being both pretty old games: their capabilities are limited, so competing with Minecraft is just impossible. Minecraft focuses on entirely different game specifics. While Fortnite offers various topics for a first-person shooting experience, Minecraft gives tools you can use, and what you make of it is up to each player.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-minecraft-as-a-valuable-addition-to-your-career-and-personal-life"><strong>Minecraft as a Valuable Addition to Your Career and Personal Life</strong></h3>



<p>YouTube is now a channel that could bring financial benefits when an audience emerges. YouTubers help Minecraft enthusiasts keep track of what has changed since the last login, what new modes, innovations, and modpacks are worth trying out later. Numerous content creators focus on family-friendly content. If you are a person who likes to film, edit the content, post it on youtube, you can really make a living out of it. However, increasing competition needs to be mentioned here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are also builders &#8211; they create maps for people requesting it, and earn money from it. <a href="https://www.minezmap.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MineZ Map</a> is a great example. If your work involves art, you can always make an art gallery or display your products through a Minecraft game, whether it is a car design, advertising banner, or architectural building. Especially for developers, Minecraft is a giant canvas to test your dreams in reality. Everything looks in three-dimensional space, shaders are introduced, so even light falls as if in fact. And it is all free.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Eimantas</strong> distinguishes the opportunity to get to know people, discover contacts, and join clubs. A massive community exists here in the Minecraft world. One of the most popular Minecraft community initiatives is now underway &#8211; an unimaginably colossal map that matches the natural world in actual size. There is a wish to rebuild a real-world online with the appropriate buildings, and this is a massive project that Hostinger employees wish to be involved in. All landscapes of foreign landmarks (such as the Eiffel Tower, London, Moscow) are made quite accurately &#8211; you can enter the buildings and even go inside them. You walk down the street in the virtual world and feel like you are in reality.</p>



<p><strong>Ana </strong>finds computer games valuable and entertaining and equates it to a kind of therapy &#8211; it forces you to think more creatively, to escape from everyday life. Games of this type help to distract, solve other problems rather than those from your daily routine. Especially during quarantine, when everything is closed, Minecraft helps to survive and socialize from a distance. Here it is &#8211; the whole world is on the plate, take it, do it, travel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, <strong>Paulius</strong> also emphasizes the social side of the game &#8211; playing Minecraft together with his girlfriend helps them bond! Also, Hostinger employees are invited to join Hostinger&#8217;s Minecraft enthusiasts community and play on the Hostinger server. We have a logo existing, and building the company&#8217;s office is a short-term plan.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/image-1024x532.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1891" width="753" height="391" srcset="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/image-1024x532.png 1024w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/image-300x156.png 300w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/image-768x399.png 768w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/image-1536x798.png 1536w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/image.png 1679w" sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px" /></figure></div>



<h3 id="h-running-your-own-minecraft-server"><strong>Running Your Own Minecraft Server</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Paulius</strong> assures that owning a server is fantastic. Running your own server means making your own rules and installing your own plugins, maps, and mods. Players need their own servers when planning to play only with their friends since this helps protect your buildings from random people and griefers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Eimantas</strong> adds that the owned server revitalizes the game: it unlocks a large package of extra features, so it is all up to you, not the other server owner. You can invite friends from different parts of the world to play here, namely in your own space. Tautvydas has a dedicated computer in the garage to host his server &#8211; he knows that when turning on the computer, he will always come back to the same thing with no need to wait, no threat of someone connecting and ruining everything. Knowing that the risk of someone finding out your IP address is relatively high, and not everyone can put on all security matters, running your own server sounds like a great option.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hostinger&#8217;s offers are ideal for people who do not necessarily have a technical background but just want everything to work right away after connecting to their computers. <strong>Eimantas</strong> also emphasizes Hostinger&#8217;s customer support service, which you get as an essential <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/customer-loyalty-hostinger" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">feature</a> when buying a hosting deal. Hostinger&#8217;s Customer Success team is obsessed with customers and curious to help you out in every situation. We had a case when one client wanted to download a particular game modpack but failed to do so. Hostinger Customer Success agent downloaded exactly that game pack on his own computer, looked for a solution, and overcame the problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ideally, if you want a medium size server without lag so you could enjoy the game, you would need 4-8GB of RAM dedicated to the server. Yet, the more you have, the better it is for the server. Paperspigot should be used all the time due to heavy optimizations made to the server file. Hostinger provides a value-to-money <a href="../minecraft-server-hosting.html" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">solution</a> for someone who does not have a good PC, fast connection, and static IP. Owning a server solves all of these issues, and you can enjoy the game lag-free, butter-smooth, and also with your best friends. We invite you to check the <a href="https://www.bitcatcha.com/research/minecraft-server-hosting/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Bitcatcha.com overview</a> of Minecraft server hosting providers to get more details.</p>

<p>API, the acronym for Application Programming Interface, is a software intermediary that allows two applications to communicate with each other. That could be a server, a client, or an app talking to a server. The timeline below illustrates how it has evolved through the years, and it lays a great foundation of how the API can be built. REST remains a popular tool for building APIs. However, in 2012, Facebook wanted something different than REST, and that is when GraphQL (Graph Query Language) was introduced.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CkJxFmzE4C2R3oL_is9olGgjrawWAttyodXRApfJbuLoq9xpOC_S64FUdGzitHClHdl3ZJweu9aWkQbEj02RpBGWDgWIcR5U5AZaVSXl10PK0qkNiGkpJiaAqDnMBTIdwyEmliqo" alt="" /><figcaption>Source: https://blog.api.rakuten.net/graphql-vs-rest/</figcaption></figure></div>



<p></p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-rest"><strong>What is REST?</strong></h3>



<p>REST is a Representational State Transfer API, meaning that each resource has its own endpoint. Initially, it was a dissertation published by Roy Fielding in 2000 and popularized by companies like Twitter in 2006. REST is an architectural concept for network-based software. It has no official set of tools, no specification, does not particularly care if you use HTTP, AMQP, etc., and is designed to decouple an API from the client.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-main-challenges-with-rest-api"><strong>Main Challenges with REST API</strong></h3>



<p><strong>REST API sometimes requires Multiple Round Trips.</strong> This applies when we need to display some data which must be consumed from different endpoints, and consuming data from only one endpoint is not enough. The table below illustrates three endpoints:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>GET /users</td><td>List all users</td></tr><tr><td>GET /users/:id</td><td>Get the single user with id :id</td></tr><tr><td>GET /users/:id/projects</td><td>Get all projects of one user</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>What if in a client app, we need to fetch projects related to that specific user and some tasks that may also be related to the project itself? Should the back-end team develop anything extra? There are the following possible ways to do that:</p>



<ol><li>To have a query included, and then have tasks returned to each project:&nbsp; GET /users/:id/projects?include=tasks</li><li>To have a separate endpoint, resource projects, and asking a client app a query filtering based on user id:&nbsp;GET /projects?userid=:id&amp;include=tasks</li><li>To include all possible data associated with the user in one endpoint: GET /tasks?userid=:id</li></ol>



<p><strong>Over-fetching and Under-fetching.</strong> When there is a need to return too much data, the client app does not need all that data. Customers are not happy if they are required to download extra information they do not actually need. On the other hand, by reducing the level of information on a server, the problem of under-fetching can be experienced, and another extra endpoint and resource on a server to get that data is needed. The solution is: GET /users?fields=firstname,lastname.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Difficulty in creating versions and deprecating fields which are not necessary for the new releases</strong>.<strong> </strong>It is hard to maintain REST APIs when it grows over time, and different requirements are requested to support different versions of apps and multiple clients. So, usually, v1 is left as it is, and v2 is created with the newer data structure. With GraphQL, it could be done without version control. GraphQL only returns the explicitly requested data, so new capabilities can be added via new types and new fields on those types without creating a breaking change. This has led to a common practice of continuously avoiding breaking changes and serving a versionless API.</p>



<p><strong>Non-predictable data</strong>. With REST it is unknown what data will be returned from the server, what fields, how many of them, etc. With GraphQL, the client asks for specific fields to be returned. It does not matter if it is a query or mutation &#8211; you are in control of what will be returned back.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-graphql"><strong>What is GraphQL?</strong></h3>



<p>GraphQL is a newer concept, released by Facebook publicly in 2015. GraphQL, as a new way of asking data from the server, is a query language, specification, and collection of tools designed to operate over a single endpoint via HTTP, optimizing for performance and flexibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This table compares GraphQL and REST as two approaches that build API. Talking in general terms, it cannot be considered an apple-to-apple comparison, but more like an orange-to-apple parallel since the REST is the conventional standard for planning APIs, and GraphQL is a query language that helps solve problems with APIs. However, they are both still fruits <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main difference here is that GraphQL is a client-driven language. It has the architecture where the front-end app decides what data to fetch and how much it has to be returned from the server. On REST, everything is designed on the server, so the server drives the architecture.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>GraphQL</strong></td><td><strong>REST</strong></td></tr><tr><td>A query language offering efficiency and flexibility for solving common problems when integrating APIs</td><td>An architectural style largely viewed as a conventional standard for designing APIs</td></tr><tr><td>Deployed over HTTP using a single endpoint that provided the full capabilities of the exposed service</td><td>Deployed over a set of URLs where each of them exposes a single resource</td></tr><tr><td>Uses a client-driven architecture</td><td>User a server-driven architecture</td></tr><tr><td>Lacks automatic caching mechanism</td><td>Uses caching automatically</td></tr><tr><td>NO API versioning</td><td>Supports multiple API versions</td></tr><tr><td>JSON representation only</td><td>Supports multiple data formats</td></tr><tr><td>Only a single tool is used predominantly for documentation: GraphiQL</td><td>Wide range of options for automated documentation, such as OpenAPI and API Blueprint</td></tr><tr><td>Complicates handling of HTTP status codes to identify errors</td><td>Uses HTTP status codes to identify errors easily</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3 id="h-reasons-to-use-graphql"><strong>Reasons to Use GraphQL</strong></h3>



<p>There are three main reasons why we might want to consider using GraphQL instead of REST.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Network Performance. </strong>If we want to increase network performance by sending less data or sending only the information we need for clients.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>The “Include vs Endpoint” Design Choice.</strong> The tricky choice exists between <em>including the request</em> or <em>creating an additional endpoint.</em> With GraphQL that problem is solved because of the <em>schema</em> and <em>resolver</em> functions. So the client has control of what data has to be returned.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Managing different types of clients. </strong>Imagine you have one API, and all the clients (iOS app, Android app, web app, etc.) are completely different from each other: they need an entirely different structure or amount of data returned from the server. With the REST approach, you might create a separate API. On the contrary, with GraphQL, you do not need to because you can have everything returned from the single endpoint.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-how-to-get-started"><strong>How to Get Started</strong></h3>



<p>This is the breakdown of how the query is constructed. Three main parts are considered: 1) operation type, 2) operation endpoint, 3) requested fields.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/EQ9SxEmSrJinvHPf_xLl-_ScNUjLBIfHOAJNXo0hMe64T1alS2xW6jl3tsEbEhvq4sLzGmVOTR0N2w4rFMrRj2v5Pfvk55qNlV0K0-TeOaMs1cyxJD9PGdrW6xe0WVvanY8zULea" alt="" width="413" height="204" /></figure></div>



<h3 id="h-terms-to-learn"><strong>Terms to Learn</strong></h3>



<p>No matter what implementation would be chosen as there are plenty of languages, it is not only available in JavaScript or Node &#8211; you can use PHP, Python, JAVA, Go, and others. Each language has its own implementation of GraphQL, so you do not need to build everything from scratch. There are tools and packages you can use, and those terms are almost the same on all of them, so it might be worth learning them if you wish to build API using GraphQL:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Types.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1863" width="165" height="118" srcset="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Types.png 780w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Types-300x215.png 300w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Types-768x551.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 165px) 100vw, 165px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Types.</strong> The data model in GraphQL is represented in types, which are strongly typed. There should be a 1-to-1 mapping between your models and GraphQL codes. You can think of this as a database table where the user table has the fields like id, first name, last name, email, projects. So, things to remember is that exclamation point saying that an identifier (id) cannot be nullable or, in other words, it has to be something there as it’s a required field.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Queries-1024x283.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1864" width="430" height="119" srcset="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Queries-1024x283.png 1024w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Queries-300x83.png 300w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Queries-768x213.png 768w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Queries-1536x425.png 1536w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Queries.png 1546w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Queries.</strong> Queries define what queries you can run on your GraphQL API. By convention, there should be a RootQuery, which contains all the existing queries. In the example, the comment here shows how it looks on the rest API. In parenthesis around brackets, we see an argument that has to be a unique identifier, and after a colon is the type user. It shows what has to be returned when we do this query, so it returns the user. The project query will return the project, the task query will turn the list of tasks, and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Mutations-1024x137.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1866" width="525" height="70" srcset="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Mutations-1024x137.png 1024w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Mutations-300x40.png 300w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Mutations-768x103.png 768w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Mutations-1536x206.png 1536w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Mutations-2048x274.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Mutations.</strong> If queries are GET requests, mutations can be seen as POST | PATCH | PUT | DELETE requests that modify the data. The example includes mutations of “createUser”, “updateUser”, “removerUser”.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Input.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1867" width="118" height="85" srcset="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Input.png 540w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Input-300x216.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 118px) 100vw, 118px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Input.</strong> UserInput type is a User type without the id and projects fields. Notice the keyword <em>input</em> instead of <em>type</em>. You can think of this as a form on a page where you need to enter some data and what kind of information needs to be entered to create that user profile.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Resolvers.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1868" width="261" height="171" srcset="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Resolvers.png 1018w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Resolvers-300x197.png 300w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Resolvers-768x505.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Resolvers. </strong>The resolver function gives a specific set of instructions for converting the operations of GraphQL into data. It is basically a controller function, the logic of what has to be returned (resolvers for queries) when that query happens and the user asks for the data, and resolvers for mutation are used when the user seeks to update or delete the data.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Schema.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1869" width="125" height="58" srcset="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Schema.png 622w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/Schema-300x140.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 125px) 100vw, 125px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Schema. </strong>With types, queries and mutations, we define the GraphQL schema, which is what the GraphQL endpoint exposes to the world.</p>



<h3 id="h-resources-to-check"><strong>Resources to check</strong></h3>



<p>Two main resources to step deeper into the GraphQL field:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://graphql.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>GraphQL.org</strong></a>. Dedicated to learning all the basics and the actual specification of GraphQL.</li><li><a href="https://www.howtographql.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>How to GraphQL?</strong></a><strong> </strong>Dedicated to learning about implementations. For instance, if you seek to know about Apollo server, it gives you an understanding of what front-end frameworks can be used to consume the data from that API. It is not required to use any of the tools or libraries for the front-end to consume the API &#8211; you can do the regular XmlHttp request, but you must make a POST request to that endpoint and provide the query in the body, which is the GraphQL.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The GraphQL server API can be used as a gateway to other microservices, talking directly to the database or other REST APIs. Thus, you could have multiple REST APIs, get that data and make it one single source of truth.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-trends-of-the-website-energy-consumption"><strong>Trends of the Website Energy Consumption</strong></h3>



<p>The Internet uses roughly the <a href="https://www.wholegraindigital.com/blog/website-energy-efficiency/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">same amount of electricity</a> as the UK, one of the world’s largest economies. That is around 300 TWh/year. The trends of Internet growth actually show that by 2030, the Internet is projected to start using around 21% of the world&#8217;s electricity. Additionally, it is <a href="https://internethealthreport.org/2018/the-internet-uses-more-electricity-than/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">expected</a> that global communication technologies will be responsible for more carbon emissions in 2025 than any country besides China, India, and the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



<h3><strong>A Website’s Impact on the Environment</strong></h3>



<p>While the general trends are surprising, you might still be wondering – <strong>how much does one simple website impact the planet</strong>? There is, in fact, a way to calculate this, as <a href="http://www.websitecarbon.com" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">websitecarbon.com</a> can estimate the carbon footprint of a web page.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The tool offers a practical way to understand the way your website works from a broader perspective. The <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/how-does-it-work/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">calculation</a> of the website’s carbon footprint is fairly simple. First of all, it checks how much data is transferred over the wire when a web page is loaded and multiplies it with the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2078-1547/6/1/117#abstract" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">energy usage data</a>. Later, the <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">energy source</a> used by the data center is taken into consideration, and the average carbon intensity of electricity reported by the <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-co2-status-report-2018" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">International Energy Agency</a> is employed. Finally, by putting all this information together, an idea of the emissions associated with an average user visiting any given website is given, together with an estimate of the total CO2 emissions annually.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To illustrate this explanation, here is the analysis comparison between two websites: <a href="../home.html" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">hostinger.com</a>, which enables millions of people around the globe to unlock the power of the Internet by giving them tools to learn, create, and grow online, and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">BBC.com</a> – the world’s most visited news site amongst traditional news publishers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Website</strong></td><td><a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/hostinger-com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>Hostinger.com</strong></a></td><td><a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/bbc-com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>BBC.com</strong></a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>General view on cleanliness</strong></td><td>This web page is cleaner than 67% of web pages tested</td><td>This web page is dirtier than 71% of web pages tested</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Amount of CO2 produced every time someone visits the website</strong></td><td>0,55g of CO2</td><td>1,70g of CO2</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Type of energy used</strong></td><td>Sustainable energy</td><td>Bog standard energy, if this site used green hosting, it would emit 9% less CO2</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Monthly views of a website to produce:&nbsp;</strong></td><td>+/- 1,000,000</td><td>+/- 1,500,000,000</td></tr><tr><td><strong><em>Equivalent of CO2 in kilograms (over the year)</em></strong></td><td>6,550.67kg &#8211; the same weight as 43.67 sumo wrestlers and as much CO2 as boiling water for 887,624 cups of tea</td><td>30,526,564.08kg &#8211; the same weight as 203,510.43 sumo wrestlers and as much CO2 as boiling water for 4,136,390,796 cups of tea</td></tr><tr><td><strong><em>Number of trees needed to absorb the amount of carbon created by this website (over the year)</em></strong></td><td>298</td><td>1,387,572</td></tr><tr><td><strong><em>Amount of energy used (over the year)</em></strong></td><td>15,217kWh of energy &#8211; enough electricity to drive an electric car 97,338km</td><td>64,266,451kWh of energy &#8211; enough electricity to drive an electric car 411,205,284km</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>By looking at them from a broader perspective, these numbers are shocking – in this scenario, more than 1 million 300 thousand trees would be needed to absorb the amount of carbon generated by BBC.com over the year! As web developers, we like to think about this issue every time we make changes to the website, as they all have an impact on the planet.</p>



<p></p>



<h3><strong>Website’s Performance <em>versus </em>Energy Consumption</strong></h3>



<p>Over the past decade, the medium size of a website has increased around 4 times. In 2010, it was 500kb, and this year, the medium size of a website is 2MB. Considering how much the Internet has blown up over the years and the number of websites currently found online, that’s a massive amount of data being used. What’s more, these numbers have a tendency to keep growing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This number could have possibly been even higher by now, if not for initiatives such as Google’s Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights, and most recently, the Core Web Vitals update being implemented. By being strict with these guidelines, Google states that if your website’s performance score goes low, it will push your website’s rankings down. In general, this forces developers and website owners to take better care of their websites, which is beneficial for all Internet ecosystems.</p>



<p>The correlation between performance scores and energy consumption of mobile web apps was <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341123776_Investigating_the_Correlation_between_Performance_Scores_and_Energy_Consumption_of_Mobile_Web_Apps" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">investigated</a> as well. Out of the 100 most popular websites ranked by <a href="https://www.alexa.com/topsites" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Alexa</a>, 21 were randomly chosen and tested on a mobile device using the Google Chrome browser. Researchers turned off all the background programs on the device and measured the device’s energy to load a particular website. Each website was tested 25 times to analyze how long it takes to fully load the website, how many CPUs are needed, and what is the primary energy consumption amount until the website loads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As is stated in the research paper, “Our results show a significant <strong>negative</strong> <strong>correlation</strong> between the performance score and the energy consumption of a mobile web app. Overall, we can state that the performance analysis tools like Lighthouse can be used as proxies for energy consumption.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most low-performance level websites use a lot more energy than the ones with average-performance and good-performance levels. So, quite literally, making your performance scores better will help to save the planet.</p>



<h3><strong>How Much Energy Does Your Website Use When People Are Browsing It?</strong></h3>



<p>Tools like Lighthouse or websitecarbon.com measure the energy usage upon the initial loading of a website. However, that&#8217;s not where the story ends – people will start browsing. How can we measure that?</p>



<p>The Safari Timelines tool allows you to monitor what happens to your website, all categorized into <strong>Network Requests</strong>, <strong>Layout and Rendering</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript and Events</strong>, as well as how much CPU is used during every moment of your website lifecycle in the meantime. This tool is partly similar to the Google Performance and Firefox Performance tabs, but it allows you to actually monitor your website’s performance in real-time. In comparison, with the Google tool, you’d have to record and check it later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A simple countdown timer calculating the time until July 5 is used to illustrate this example. When a timer ticks every second, three distinct tasks will run. The first one is a JavaScript event that triggers the change of the timer.&nbsp; And then, there are two layout events – one is an invalidation of the current layout and the second will paint the new number on the screen. All of this uses energy.</p>



<p>What happens if we decide to leave the timer bar open, go to Google.com, search for something, and come back? As we were doing so, some JavaScript events, as well as the repainting of the timer were running. So, the CPU was still used. What can we do to avoid this, making it so that the website could be suspended while we’re on the other tab?   </p>

<h3><strong>How to Save Computer Energy? </strong></h3>



<p>When running websites, we do not need to constantly keep executing every part of the code. By taking a look at some Countdown &amp; Scrolling examples, we will provide you with several options to save computer energy.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Page visibility API.</strong> By adding an event listener which listens to visibility changes on the website, we can ensure that our code of the countdown is only executing when the page is in visibility mode. In this case, if the page is in the other, non-visible tab, code is not being executed. Once you navigate back to the page and the countdown becomes visible, the code will start being executed again and the functions called every second. Checking for visibility in web pages allows users to save computer energy.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="657" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-25-at-19.05.59-1024x657.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1852" srcset="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-25-at-19.05.59-1024x657.png 1024w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-25-at-19.05.59-300x192.png 300w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-25-at-19.05.59-768x493.png 768w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-25-at-19.05.59-1536x985.png 1536w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-25-at-19.05.59-2048x1314.png 2048w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-25-at-19.05.59.png 1730w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Blur and focus events. </strong>Another helpful way of saving computer energy is by adding event listeners for blur and focus events. By checking this for the website window, we can achieve a similar effect as in the step above. We need to execute the countdown only when the page is in focus, this way, when the page is in blur mode (running in the back, partially visible), the countdown does not always need to be executed. This saves a lot of energy when the user forgets about a window he had left open or leaves the computer running for a while with the page in blur mode. If this option is used, the page is left static, with no code being executed when unnecessary.</li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>Intersection observer API.</strong> The usage of scrolling is another valuable option. Let’s assume that our goal is to check when a particular element on a website is visible or not during scrolling. This can be achieved with a simple listener of scrolling and a function for visibility. However, this way, the function would be executed with each little scroll on the website. To avoid this, we could use the Intersection observer API. By doing so, we could limit the calls of Javascript code so that it would only be called when a user scrolls to a specific place on the web page. An additional benefit to this is that it requires only to initiate the Intersection observer element, and it allows to define a callback function, with the user then telling the observer to observe the element. When the element is in the view, a callback function is called, and we can perform an action with the element.</li></ul>

<h3><strong>How Much Does an Actual CPU Cost?</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-25-at-18.07.42-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1841" width="299" height="164" srcset="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-25-at-18.07.42-4.png 550w, https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-25-at-18.07.42-4-300x165.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px" /></figure></div>



<p>The average consumption of the timer for 62 seconds is 0,4%, and the electricity usage is 60 watts when the CPU is at the maximum capacity for a MacBook Pro (2015).&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we take the kWh prices in Lithuania into consideration, just having a simple countdown timer on your website could cost you 0,3 Eur per year. Sounds like a <em>skimpy </em>issue? It’s true, but then again, the simple timer is just a tiny drop in the ocean that is your website.</p>



<h3><strong>Sustainable Web Manifesto</strong></h3>



<p>We aimed to show how much our work online impacts the environment and suggested several tools make it more efficient. However, to summarize everything, our most important point stands –&nbsp;we must build more sustainable websites. The <a href="https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sustainable Web Manifesto</a> states that we all share and use the web, just as we all share and live on this planet. This manifesto is a public declaration of a shared commitment to creating a sustainable Internet. It has major six rules:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Clean.</strong> The services we provide and the services we use will be powered by renewable energy.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Efficient.</strong> The products and services we provide will use the least amount of energy and material resources possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Open.</strong> The products and services we provide will be accessible, allow for the open exchange of information, and allow users to control their data.</li><li><strong>Honest. </strong>The products and services we provide will not mislead or exploit users in their design or content.</li><li><strong>Regenerative. </strong>The products and services we provide will support an economy that nourishes the people and the planet.</li><li><strong>Resilient. </strong>The products and services we provide will function in the times and places where people need them most.</li></ul>



<p>We are all responsible for it. Thus, we invite you to use this manifesto as a guideline when building your website – all for a safer, more sustainable Internet.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There is something <em>snazzy </em>about being called <strong>a startup</strong>. What comes to your mind first? Flexible working schedules, <a href="https://unicorns.lt/en/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">unicorns</a>, colorful open offices, pizza parties, and free snacks, or maybe family-like teams, countless hours on a laptop, and endless uncertainties?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In its purest form, a startup is defined as a company in the first stage of its operations, usually seeking proof of concept, market validation, and funding in order to scale. This definition has been expanded to include more ideas that make up a modern entrepreneurial company. While we do have a clear idea of what a startup is, there has never been an apparent line as to when a startup stops being a startup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When does it really become a “company” in its traditional meaning and definition? And could a full-fledged company still keep some entrepreneurial elements in its approach and execution even after 5 or 10 years of operations?</p>



<h3 id="h-a-startup-by-definition"><strong>A Startup by Definition</strong></h3>



<p>We can refer to startups as the <a href="https://blog.helpdocs.io/when-is-a-startup-no-longer-a-startup/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">difference makers and the dreamers</a> – hungry for achievements, desired to develop a unique product or service and bring it to the market by disrupting it. Likewise, Paul Graham, the founder of Y Combinator, describes a <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">startup</a> as a company designed to grow fast with no time limit present. However, it still seems that such market-changing players like Uber, Amazon, Tesla are no longer called startups despite their continuous growth.</p>



<p>There have been many attempts to set a numerical limit on what separates a startup from a company by the number of employees, revenue, profit, funding specifics, and more. One of these, called the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/30/what-the-hell-is-a-startup-anyway/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALtP7ISlwInawxcMlwnfocAQKWmsaCfjFKgRAKXYN6gPrWoRL4o47ZlRatV3kKSwDLlwIlIpMZs87hnDzznKqxQ6xJiLaTL63cR1xmR_MplM2Xa3Xqi35C3OUMAE4r2TPh6Z6k0pHkXCnWnL6Ls2pi6S0xyXtLvyC30IxKpmwksE" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">50-100-500</a> rule suggests hanging up your Startup Uniform if any of the following guidelines could be applied to your company:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>$50 million revenue run rate (forward 12 months);</li><li>100 or more employees;</li><li>Worth more than $500 million, on paper or otherwise.</li></ul>



<p>So what if your company achieved or surpassed these numbers but still feels like a startup at heart?&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-the-startup-soul"><strong>The Startup Soul</strong></h3>



<p>When being asked to define their company’s culture, employees often start talking about the flexible working environments, cool offices, attention to work-life balance, original events, and dynamic team structures. What truly is missing from these descriptions is the ability to articulate a company&#8217;s true identity, since <a href="https://www.business.com/articles/at-what-point-are-you-no-longer-a-startup/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">“putting a ping pong table in the offices of IBM won’t make it a startup”</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Entrepreneurs should play with and explore ideas, letting their strategies evolve through a seamless process of guesswork, analysis, and action” &#8211; has been stated in Amar Bhide’s <a href="https://hbr.org/1994/03/how-entrepreneurs-craft-strategies-that-work" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><em>How Entrepreneurs Craft Strategies That Work</em></a> back in 1994. Via such play and exploration, startup culture has grown in stature over the last decade, creating an entire movement of companies that developed exciting, progressive, valuable products and services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to innovative companies like Netflix, Facebook, Airbnb, and more, the <strong>startup mindset</strong><em> </em>is now a relevant section in the modern business dictionary. Hence, this forward-oriented thinking is characterized by opportunity obsession, idea-drivenness, focus on execution, and readiness to change the course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/07/the-soul-of-a-start-up" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">research</a> published by Harvard Business Review shows that there is a certain energy, or <strong>soul</strong> present in startups, which inspires employees to contribute their talent and enthusiasm, investors and customers to commit their money, and founders to believe that their ventures were something above their missions and business models. Based on such findings, the startup soul is laid out into three key principles, which help a company remain innovative and maintain continuous growth:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Business intent (the meaning for work, the real true self of an organization);</li><li>Customer connection (customer obsession explained which bonds them with a company);</li><li>Employee experience (empowering the ones forming emotional ties with the company and motivating them to go the extra mile).&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Company culture is never built in a day and is not just limited to organizational values and guiding principles. The major challenge is keeping these three elements on top of a business strategy and daily activities in order to preserve the startup soul and maintain <strong>entrepreneurial flair</strong> during the growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-hostinger-s-view-on-startup-culture"><strong>Hostinger’s View On Startup Culture</strong></h3>



<p>Hostinger was <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/hello-world" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">bootstrapped in 2004</a>, and we’ve been on an epic ride ever since. It is already a fully-fledged, profitable business model that is rapidly scaling and leaving the original startup definition behind. The necessity to start talking about the culture at Hostinger arose when we began to look for a business approach on how to evaluate an employee’s performance without going into the emotional and personal assessment of work. Values of successful entrepreneurial companies like Netflix, Google, Amazon were the aspiration for us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, from our perspective, startups are about the <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/hostinger-culture-that-fuels-personal-and-global-growth" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">culture</a> – the freedom to act, make decisions, follow principles and values as a guiding line in all business activities.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center"><p><em>Culture is how we behave when nobody is watching. This is how we see the culture, and it is reflected in the principles of our work. High-pace, high-standards, result-orientation – this is a culture that encourages personal and organizational learning and growth.”</em></p><p><strong>Gabija Marganavičė, Chief People Officer at Hostinger</strong></p></blockquote>



<p id="h-our-unified-hostinger-principles-both-set-the-tone-for-global-hiring-and-promotion-processes-and-also-serve-as-a-bottom-line-each-employee-is-given-all-the-tools-to-be-successful-at-hostinger-and-it-depends-on-the-person-s-motivation-and-competence-to-build-his-success-story-here-says-gabija-marganavi-cpo-at-hostinger">Our unified <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/hostinger-culture-that-fuels-personal-and-global-growth" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">Hostinger Principles</a> both set the tone for global hiring and promotion processes and also serve as a bottom line. “Each employee is given all the tools to be successful at Hostinger, and it depends on the person’s motivation and competence to build his success story here”, says Gabija Marganavičė, CPO at Hostinger.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="h-the-freedom-to-learn-investigate-make-mistakes-experiment-and-grow-comes-with-considerable-responsibilities-since-our-culture-stands-as-a-merger-between-the-guiding-principles-and-the-team-the-people-s-success-is-the-company-s-success-at-hostinger">The freedom to learn, investigate, make mistakes, experiment, and grow comes with considerable responsibilities. Since our culture stands as a merger between the guiding principles and the team, the people’s success is the company’s success at Hostinger.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-measuring-the-culture"><strong>Measuring the Culture</strong></h3>



<p>Challenging stereotypes and standards in a multinational environment is a daily process here at Hostinger. Due to the current pandemic situation, more than 1000 employees from 35 countries worldwide work remotely. Culture is the central element that unites us all, and there is no recognized need to localize it, according to Justina Telyčėnė, People Partner at Hostinger.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center"><p><em>“Subcultures occur, and they are greatly determined by the multiple localities at Hostinger. No matter which country our employees come from, our strategy and goals remain the same, requiring similar tools to achieve our objectives. Perhaps, one principle will appear more in one location than in the other, but the cultural environment must still be the same. Subcultures are acceptable as long as they work together towards a unified purpose and according to the same principles.”</em></p><p><strong>Justina Telyčėnė, People Partner at Hostinger</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>By not localizing the culture, we aim to ensure that we are all on the same page and can accurately measure our culture’s individual and organizational impact. The Net Promoter Score (NPS) and Team Pulse methods are applied to work on the culture and improve it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on NPS data, we can see whether employees are willing to recommend Hostinger as a place to work, followed by questions of what could be done better if the evaluation does not meet the maximum score. Accordingly, a monthly Team Pulse survey focuses on the <a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">five principles</a> that an effective team must follow (psychological safety, dependability, structure &amp; clarity, meaning of work, impact of work).&nbsp;</p>

As a startup expands, additional formal structures and processes must be added and applied to manage the business. And nothing is wrong with healthy corporate environments – they can bring transparency and simplicity if processes are efficiently arranged. Consequently, Hostinger’s example illustrates the new type of corporate structure, which includes business intent, customer connection, and employee experience as the main ingredients, all with an entrepreneurial flavor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike huge corporations, startups don’t have the luxury of a slow crawl – customers do not have the time to wait for a startup to adapt, and unfilled gaps to satisfy their needs are speedily filled in by competitors. Therefore, <strong>Hostinger’s true self</strong> consists of speed in decisions, testing through errors rather than waiting for the best option, and delivering quality results fast. Gintarė Stundytė, COO at Hostinger, defines us as “a bunch of people united by a few key elements: we like to deliver results, learn a lot, and do things fast. We know that happy customers are critical for a growing business, and we want to prove that Lithuania is a place where Unicorns are born.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Customer Obsession is what you live, eat, and breathe every day, 365 days a year. It is simply the way you run your company… always putting the customers’ well-being in front of everything else you are doing”, as <a href="https://blainemillet.medium.com/customer-obsession-isnt-a-buzzword-it-s-a-way-of-life-96a64d98563a" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">stated</a> by Blaine Millet, describes <strong>Hostinger’s customer connection </strong>as the key element of this new type of entrepreneurial corporation. We extensively research and strive to <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/customer-success-specialist-journey/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">understand our customers</a> better, working with great effort to earn and keep their trust.&nbsp;</p>

This kind of bond needs a constant boost to grow both individually and as a team. Therefore, in a fully-fledged organization like Hostinger, startup culture serves as an accelerator for employees to deliver results. And this is what we think motivates and makes the best people stay – curious colleagues and a fast-changing environment composed to deliver results.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-maintain-startup-culture-while-rapidly-expanding"><strong>How to Maintain Startup Culture While Rapidly Expanding&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>From Hostinger’s experience, we’ve recognized a need for a startup to incorporate discipline and order into its business activities as it grows. Higher efficiency, maintained customer bond, and team connection are expected if such adjustments are implemented thoughtfully.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The culture will change together with the startup, whether we want it or not – and that is not something to be afraid of. Company culture stands as the only element that can never be copied by competitors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are some practical tips from Hostinger to maintain a startup culture even when you’ve made it big:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Keeping processes open</strong>, <strong>transparent, and honest</strong>. <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/3-game-changing-processes-that-got-us-results" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">Objectives and Key Results </a>(OKRs) is the goal-setting methodology and management tool used at Hostinger. It indicates the initiatives we focus on in a particular quarter. OKRs are viewable across the organization from the CEO down to the Intern, thus every employee is welcome to share his views, suggest ideas, and question the direction.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Maintaining high work organization standards.</strong> A person is hired, promoted, and dismissed at Hostinger, all based on the <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/hostinger-culture-that-fuels-personal-and-global-growth" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">10 guiding principles</a>. We do not rely on time worked, location, race, gender, etc. Thus, if results are delivered, the opportunity for advancement can quickly open up.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Leading by example.</strong> Our CTO, Balys Krikščiūnas, started his career path in Hostinger as a Customer Success specialist and the third employee of the company. There is no better person to build the product than the one who truly knows Hostinger’s customers from the bottom to the top. By placing Hostinger’s senior leadership knowledge, experience, and external resources in a development framework based on our principles, the <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/managers-academy-explained" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">MANAGER’S ACADEMY</a> at Hostinger was started. The goal of it is to develop mindful leaders keen to think – critically and openly.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Offering a chance to experiment and continuously learn.</strong> Constant learning and development are the daily elements of startup operations. And Hostinger is no exception here. Customer Success: Know It All, Tech Guild, Designers Guild, Manager’s Academy are just a few successful, attention-grabbing examples of internal initiatives increasing employee engagement and providing us with practical takeaways later on adapted to daily tasks and objectives.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Celebrating small successes. </strong>Each OKR finishes with reached results, and we wish to acknowledge them. After summarizing the quarter results in key meetings, we have a celebration. COVID-19 did not take away this tradition, and the achievements are being recognized in online events and interactions, boosting employees’ engagement and motivation for one more challenging quarter ahead.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>As a startup is driven by entrepreneurial ideas and the aim to create a sustainable business model, we could state that once a venture has proof that an idea works and achieves its potential by the growth of scale and revenue, it is no longer a startup. And we are not an exception here &#8211; being technically not a startup anymore, Hostinger still keeps an entrepreneurial flair at heart as it scales. “It doesn’t matter how good your original product is, if you can’t build a great company around it, the product won’t endure” stated by Brian Chesky, the co-founder and CEO of Airbnb, summarizes it all. Even after reaching the big leagues and getting out of the startup arena, maintaining a startup culture is what creates the magic and ensures continuous innovation and growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the current business context, customer loyalty is defined as the ability of a company to retain customers and turn them into recurring revenue. The phrase “customer loyalty” is usually accompanied by analytics reports and metrics that try to decipher a customer’s buying habits, tendencies, frequency of purchases and apply the necessary tactics and strategy to improve them. At Hostinger, “customer loyalty” has an entirely different meaning.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="h-customer-obsession-at-hostinger"><strong>Customer Obsession at Hostinger</strong></h4>



<p><strong>It all begins with the customer</strong>. One of the core Hostinger values is <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/principles" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">Customer Obsession</a>. The driving force behind every product, every service, every campaign, and every interaction, is the goal of helping people come one step closer to their online success. We never view customers as numbers, and we never try to quantify success in numbers. Our philosophy is that aiming to help people as passionately and informatively as possible is the only way to do business &#8211; and the numbers will take care of themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Early on in the company’s journey, we became aware of the evolution of the customer loyalty concept. What ensued was a conscious decision to build a Customer Success team equipped with the right skills and mindset to serve customers in a way that they’ve never been served before. We wanted to create an environment where people are safe to resort to for answers. We wanted to make it <strong>easy for customers to reach out</strong> for help and even easier to get it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Customer Success is the main team directly responsible for dealing with customers, there’s a lot more that goes into this. From the data team, analyzing market tendencies and preferences, and Product owners that build products according to customer surveys to web developers interviewing customers regarding UX, there are a lot of people working silently behind the scenes. Their common goal? Make products and services that customers want to use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our teams incorporate feedback from customers into their work on a daily basis. Our work is constant, relentless fine-tuning. Polishing what we have built based on what people want, on what people need.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="h-the-relation-between-a-customer-and-a-brand">The Relation Between a Customer And a Brand </h4>



<p>Gone are the days when customer loyalty was something you had to win over by enticing people into reward schemes, free giveaways, and heavy marketing strategies. Now, customers have the luxury of choice and are more informed than at any point in modern history. They know what they’re looking for, and more importantly, know when they’re not getting what they signed up for. Customers do not get behind products but behind brands. The relationship between a customer and a brand goes more profound than an exchange of money for service &#8211; it’s about trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We live in an era where people evaluate brands the same way they evaluate other people that let into their life. Customers expect to see things like open communication, care, attention, attentiveness, appreciation, and longevity. They are no longer impressed by flashy gifts in the early stages of the relationship. Instead, <strong>they look for consistency and a brand they can rely on in the long run</strong>. At Hostinger, we understand that the only way to achieve customer loyalty is by first proving we are loyal to our customers, and prioritizing customer needs in every business goal.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="h-building-trust-and-giving-a-timely-solution"><strong>Building Trust and Giving a Timely Solution</strong></h4>



<p>We never treated customer loyalty as a separate project, something we had to worry about outside of the reason we built this company in the first place. People will always return to places and companies they have found comfort, solutions, and positivity. We are firm believers that if we offer people the most affordable, highest quality, and performance online hosting they can get, they will have a reason to return.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Loyalty is built over time, repetition, and friction. It is not given, it’s earned. It is the way you treat people in times of distress, crisis, and frustration. We’ve never believed in winning people over by sending them discount codes but <strong>being available to guide them through times of uncertainty and trouble</strong>. We help customers rank better in search engines, help them protect their website, set up their SSL, <a href="../pricing.html" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">choose the right hosting plan</a> for their needs, build a website that’s fast, efficient, and stands out. <strong>Loyalty is the bond of trust you build</strong> during email or chat exchanges, the feeling of relief you get when you get a timely solution to a problem that might have ruined your day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And just because theory means nothing without real-life applications, let’s look at some real-life examples that can help you contextualize the ideas presented in this article.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/PelYdLPGKa-tBu3kkvIVabWOjJPqlkYVjDV1KFiWI77t9m1zb1iVtPOE8AAWZe9B0iId7uUN8CIa4NNGDdWDhF2kbC1pCW39bQzbs7X2tRkOFGBsV5WdfOB9j8GOtuc7zIxj5liE" alt="" width="630" height="322" /></figure></div>



<p>Nothing says success more than someone who is willing to recommend your services to a friend. This is not a popular metric. This is proof of a true connection between company and customer. This is evidence that there is a personal approach, understanding, honesty and empathy.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Vj86xoCRhj8fXKUnuIZ2LOXusCCOB8i3ZQ__2a6uJxmjTH5JpJ_54ZMDXTxCxYGzd27uP6LysSuVU-iUEMqgRif0uh13JCs4PWAEpDNEIeZCpV43uPUbP0koVosLv6VBDIs5LHvV" alt="" width="523" height="475" /></figure></div>



<p>Giving customers exactly what they ask for is absolutely amazing! Do you know what’s even better? Giving them more, simply because you want to see them succeed. This chat is a perfect example of how a member of our team exceeded expectations and pointed the customer in a direction that could help them immensely. As far as the customer was concerned, the chat was about to end with their problem resolved and their questions answered. But, no!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our understanding of the customer and appreciation for what they do has taught us that giving more never goes to waste. Give without expecting back, give like you’d give to a friend, to a loved one. People appreciate honesty, attention, and the genuine desire to help.</p>
