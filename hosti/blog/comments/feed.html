					<description><![CDATA[Hey there, I am currently thinking about buying your WordPress hosting of rs219 but a little bit confused. Can we scale up our previous WordPress hosting in case of high traffic because I am currently buying a 219rs plan but will shift to higher plans if scaling to large traffic is possible!]]></description>

Hey, Tobi! Even though all the plans are compatible with WordPress, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hostinger.com/wordpress-hosting&quot;&gt;WordPress hosting&lt;/a&gt; plans are optimized especially for this CMS. In your case, I would choose this option <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/263a.png" alt="☺" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>
